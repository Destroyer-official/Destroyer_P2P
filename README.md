## Security Features In-Depth

### üõ°Ô∏è Hybrid Post-Quantum Cryptography

Combines traditional and post-quantum algorithms to ensure security against both classical and quantum attacks:

- **Key Exchange**: X3DH (Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman) with X25519 + ML-KEM-1024
- **Signatures**: FALCON-1024 for quantum-resistant digital signatures
- **Benefits**: Maintains security even if either classical or quantum algorithm is compromised

### üîÑ Multi-Layered Encryption

Four independent encryption layers with different security properties:

1. **TLS 1.3**: Transport security with PQ-enhanced cipher suites
2. **Double Ratchet**: End-to-end encryption with forward secrecy and break-in recovery
3. **Application-Layer Encryption**: Multiple ciphers (XChaCha20-Poly1305, AES-256-GCM)
4. **Certificate Exchange**: Additional ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption for certificate exchange

### üñ•Ô∏è Hardware Security Integration

Cross-platform interface for hardware security elements:

- **Windows**: CNG (Cryptography API: Next Generation) with TPM 2.0 integration
- **Linux/macOS**: PKCS#11 for HSM interface
- **Capabilities**:
  - Secure random number generation from hardware sources
  - Hardware-backed key generation when available
  - Protected signing operations using keys stored in secure hardware

### üîê Secure Key Management

Advanced key storage with OS-specific best practices:

- **Storage Options**:
  - **OS Keyring**: Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Keyring
  - **Secure Filesystem**: OS-specific secure locations with strict permissions
  - **In-Memory**: Zero-persistence mode for maximum security
- **Process Isolation**: Key operations in separate process on POSIX systems
- **Memory Protection**: Secure memory wiping, canary values, and anti-debugging features

## Advanced Protection Features

### üìä Traffic Analysis Resistance

Sophisticated techniques to prevent message length analysis:

- **Variable Message Padding**: Random padding (1-30 bytes) added to each message
- **Constant-Size Messages**: All messages padded to similar size (~1350-1420 bytes)
- **FALCON Signature Padding**: Large signatures (~1270 bytes) provide baseline size
- **Indistinguishable Messages**: Heartbeats, short messages, and long messages all appear identical on the network

### üîÑ Double Ratchet Enhancement

Advanced improvements to the Signal Protocol's Double Ratchet:

- **Post-Quantum Integration**: ML-KEM for additional ratchet steps
- **Quantum-Resistant Authentication**: FALCON-1024 signatures for message authentication
- **Multiple Chain Keys**: Enhanced key derivation with additional entropy sources
- **Memory-Hardened Storage**: Protected memory for sensitive ratchet state

### üß© Anti-Forensic Design

Features to minimize persistent traces:

- **In-Memory Operation**: Option to keep all keys in RAM only
- **Secure Memory Wiping**: Explicit memory clearing with verification
- **Ephemeral Identity**: Automatic rotation of all cryptographic identities
- **Zero-Knowledge Design**: No central servers or persistent identifiers

### üîç Security Monitoring

Built-in security monitoring capabilities:

- **Entropy Verification**: Ensures cryptographic materials have sufficient randomness
- **Canary Values**: Memory integrity checks to detect tampering
- **Heartbeat Encryption**: Encrypted keepalive messages to maintain connection security
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies potential security issues during operation

### üÜî Ephemeral Identities

Enhances privacy and thwarts long-term tracking:

- **Automatic Identity Rotation**: All cryptographic identifiers (keys, certificates) are automatically rotated at configurable intervals (e.g., every hour or day).
- **No Persistent Identifiers**: The system avoids long-term static identifiers that could be used to track users over time.
- **Untraceable Sessions**: Each communication session can appear to originate from a new, unrelated identity, making it difficult to link sessions or build a profile of a user.
- **Increased Anonymity**: Complements other security layers by making it harder to attribute communication to specific individuals over extended periods.

- **HSM Support**: PKCS#11 interface for hardware security modules
- **Protected Operations**: Key generation and signing in secure hardware
- **Memory Protection**: Defense against cold boot and memory dumping attacks

## Dependencies

This project relies on several external Python libraries and core internal modules:

### External Libraries (from PyPI)

These should be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`:

```
cryptography>=3.4.0      # Core cryptographic operations (AES, ChaCha20, RSA, ECC)
keyring>=23.0.0          # Secure OS-specific credential storage (keychain, credential manager)
pyzmq>=22.0.0            # Inter-process communication for key management isolation (POSIX)
python-pkcs11            # PKCS#11 interface for HSMs (Linux/macOS only)
```

### Core Internal Modules & Custom Libraries

These modules are part of the project's codebase:

- **`quantcrypt`**: A custom local library providing implementations for the post-quantum algorithms ML-KEM (for Key Encapsulation) and FALCON (for digital signatures). This module is essential for the hybrid post-quantum security features.
- **`platform_hsm_interface.py`** (often imported as `cphs`): This is the core internal module that provides the cross-platform hardware security abstraction layer. It interfaces with Windows CNG/TPM and PKCS#11 for HSMs on Linux/macOS.
- Other Python files like `secure_p2p.py`, `hybrid_kex.py`, `double_ratchet.py`, etc., constitute the main application logic and security protocols.
