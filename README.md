## Security Features In-Depth

### 🛡️ Hybrid Post-Quantum Cryptography

Combines traditional and post-quantum algorithms to ensure security against both classical and quantum attacks:

- **Key Exchange**: X3DH (Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman) with X25519 + ML-KEM-1024.
  - **HKDF Root Key Derivation**: The initial shared secret from X3DH+PQ is processed with HKDF using a specific `info` string (`b'Hybrid X3DH+PQ Root Key'`) to produce the master root key for the session.
  - **Post-Quantum Ciphertext Validation**: Received ML-KEM-1024 ciphertexts are validated for correct length (`MLKEM1024_CIPHERTEXT_SIZE`). The underlying `quantcrypt` library's decapsulation process further validates ciphertext integrity, with errors robustly handled.
  - **Binding of EC & PQ Shares**: Ephemeral Elliptic Curve (EC) shares and Post-Quantum (PQ) KEM ciphertexts are cryptographically bound using an ephemeral FALCON-1024 signature (`ec_pq_binding_sig`). This signature covers the concatenation of the ephemeral EC public key and the KEM ciphertext, preventing mix-and-match attacks.
  - **Signature Key Reuse Prevention**: Each handshake utilizes a freshly generated ephemeral FALCON-1024 key pair for signing handshake components (like the EC-PQ binding). The longer-term identity FALCON key is only used to sign these ephemeral FALCON public keys. In the default ephemeral mode, main identity keys (including the main FALCON key) are also periodically rotated.
- **Signatures**: FALCON-1024 for quantum-resistant digital signatures.
- **Benefits**: Maintains security even if either classical or quantum algorithm is compromised.

### 🔄 Multi-Layered Encryption

Four independent encryption layers with different security properties:

1. **TLS 1.3**: Transport security with PQ-enhanced cipher suites.
2. **Double Ratchet**: End-to-end encryption with forward secrecy and break-in recovery. (See "Double Ratchet Enhancement" for more details).
3. **Application-Layer Encryption**: Multiple ciphers (XChaCha20-Poly1305, AES-256-GCM).
4. **Certificate Exchange**: Additional ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption for certificate data during exchange.
   - **Secure Key Derivation**: The ChaCha20Poly1305 key for certificate exchange is derived using HKDF-SHA256 to ensure the correct 32-byte key length, preventing vulnerabilities from incorrect key sizes. Errors during certificate encryption/decryption are handled to abort the exchange if security cannot be guaranteed.

### 🖥️ Hardware Security Integration

Cross-platform interface for hardware security elements:

- **Windows**: CNG (Cryptography API: Next Generation) with TPM 2.0 integration
- **Linux/macOS**: PKCS#11 for HSM interface
- **Capabilities**:
  - Secure random number generation from hardware sources
  - Hardware-backed key generation when available
  - Protected signing operations using keys stored in secure hardware

### 🔐 Secure Key Management

Advanced key storage with OS-specific best practices:

- **Storage Options**:
  - **OS Keyring**: Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, Linux Keyring
  - **Secure Filesystem**: OS-specific secure locations with strict permissions
  - **In-Memory**: Zero-persistence mode for maximum security
- **Process Isolation**: Key operations in separate process on POSIX systems
- **Memory Protection**: Secure memory wiping, canary values, and anti-debugging features

### 🛡️ Layered Security Model

The application employs multiple layers of security to protect data in transit. The following diagram illustrates how a user's message is encapsulated:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Network Transmission (OS Kernel)"
        TCPIP["TCP/IP Frame\\n(Contains Encrypted TLS Record)"]
    end
    subgraph "Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.3 Channel)"
        TLS_Packet["TLS Record\\n(Contains Encrypted Double Ratchet Message)"]
    end
    subgraph "End-to-End Encrypted Message (Double Ratchet Protocol)"
        DR_Message["Double Ratchet Message\\n(Header + Encrypted Padded User Data + Signature)"]
    end

        User_Message["Original User Message (Plaintext String)"]
    end

    Padded_Message -- "Double Ratchet Encryption (`ratchet.encrypt`)" --> DR_Message
    DR_Message -- "TLS Encryption (SSL Socket)" --> TLS_Packet
    TLS_Packet -- "TCP/IP Framing (OS Network Stack)" --> TCPIP

    class TCPIP layer_net;

    subgraph "Handshake Protocols (Establish & Secure these Layers)"
      direction TB
      CertEx["Certificate Exchange (`ca_services.py`)\\n(Secures TLS identity validation)"]
      HybridKEX["Hybrid X3DH+PQ Key Exchange (`hybrid_kex.py`)\\n(Establishes root key for Double Ratchet)"]
      DRSetup["Double Ratchet Initialization (`double_ratchet.py`)\\n(Sets up initial DR state with KEX root key)"]
      TLSHandshake["TLS 1.3 Handshake (`tls_channel_manager.py`)\\n(Establishes secure transport channel using certificates)"]
    end
    
    CertEx -.-> TLSHandshake
    HybridKEX -.-> DRSetup
    DRSetup -.-> DR_Message
    TLSHandshake -.-> TLS_Packet
```
This layered approach ensures that even if one layer is compromised, others remain to protect the communication.

## Advanced Protection Features

### 📊 Traffic Analysis Resistance

Sophisticated techniques to prevent message length analysis:

- **Random Byte-Level Padding**: Each message is padded with a random number of bytes (0-15 bytes, plus a 1-byte length indicator) before encryption by `secure_p2p.py`. This further randomizes the final ciphertext length, making it harder to infer original message length from encrypted traffic.
- **Constant-Size Messages**: Due to the overhead of Double Ratchet headers (including public keys for ratchet steps) and large FALCON signatures (approx. 1270 bytes for message authentication), most encrypted messages naturally fall into a similar size range (e.g., ~1350-1420 bytes). This makes it difficult to distinguish between short messages, heartbeats, or even moderately sized user messages based purely on network packet size.
- **FALCON Signature Padding**: Large signatures (~1270 bytes) provide baseline size
- **Indistinguishable Messages**: Heartbeats, short messages, and long messages all appear identical on the network

### 🔄 Double Ratchet Enhancement

Advanced improvements to the Signal Protocol's Double Ratchet:

- **Post-Quantum Integration**: ML-KEM for additional ratchet steps, deriving fresh entropy.
- **Quantum-Resistant Authentication**: FALCON-1024 signatures for authenticating messages within the Double Ratchet encrypted channel.
- **Multiple Chain Keys & Robust Key Derivation**:
  - **Comprehensive Domain Separation**: While the initial root key comes from the hybrid KEX, all subsequent key derivations within the Double Ratchet (for root key updates, sending/receiving chain keys, and message keys) use HKDF-SHA512 with a comprehensive set of unique, purpose-specific `info` strings. This rigorously separates cryptographic contexts (e.g., `DR_ROOT_UPDATE_HYBRID_MLKEM1024_DH_v2`, `DR_CHAIN_INIT_SEND_X25519_v2`, etc.).
  - **Message Key Derivation**: Message keys are derived from chain keys using HMAC-SHA256 (e.g., `HMAC(chain_key, KDF_INFO_MSG, ...)`), with distinct HMAC keys (`KDF_INFO_MSG` vs. `KDF_INFO_CHAIN`) for message keys and next chain keys, ensuring their cryptographic independence without relying on simple counter concatenation for this step.
  - **Resilience to Input Variations**: The primary KDF (`_kdf` method) uses HKDF-SHA512. It generates a salt from its `key_material` input (typically a root key) and takes its main Input Keying Material (IKM) from the outputs of DH exchanges and KEM decapsulations. This standard extract-then-expand construction of HKDF provides strong resilience against variations or potential "unusual alignments" in IKM, assuming the underlying cryptographic primitives (X25519, ML-KEM, SHA-512) are secure.
- **Memory-Hardened Storage**: Protected memory for sensitive ratchet state.
- **Replay Attack Prevention**: Implements a replay cache (`processed_message_ids` using a `collections.deque`) to store a configurable number of recently received message IDs. If a message ID is replayed, decryption is aborted, and a `SecurityError` is raised. This prevents an attacker from replaying captured ciphertexts to cause duplicate message processing or reveal repeated plaintexts.

### 🧩 Anti-Forensic Design

Features to minimize persistent traces:

- **In-Memory Operation**: Option to keep all keys in RAM only
- **Secure Memory Wiping**: Explicit memory clearing with verification
- **Ephemeral Identity**: Automatic rotation of all cryptographic identities
- **Zero-Knowledge Design**: No central servers or persistent identifiers

### 🔍 Security Monitoring

Built-in security monitoring capabilities:

- **Entropy Verification**: Ensures cryptographic materials have sufficient randomness
- **Canary Values**: Memory integrity checks to detect tampering
- **Heartbeat Encryption**: Encrypted keepalive messages to maintain connection security
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies potential security issues during operation
- **Detailed Decryption Logging**: Logs the size of incoming ciphertext before decryption, aiding in monitoring and diagnostics.

### 🆔 Ephemeral Identities

Enhances privacy and thwarts long-term tracking:

- **Automatic Identity Rotation**: All cryptographic identifiers (keys, certificates) are automatically rotated at configurable intervals (e.g., every hour or day).
- **No Persistent Identifiers**: The system avoids long-term static identifiers that could be used to track users over time.
- **Untraceable Sessions**: Each communication session can appear to originate from a new, unrelated identity, making it difficult to link sessions or build a profile of a user.
- **Increased Anonymity**: Complements other security layers by making it harder to attribute communication to specific individuals over extended periods.
