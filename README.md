  </p>
</div>

### 🔍 Comprehensive Security Testing

The system includes a rigorous security test suite that systematically validates all cryptographic components:

- **Certificate Authentication Security**: Verifies the certificate exchange process with proper key derivation and validates the fix for the ChaCha20Poly1305 key size vulnerability
  
- **Hybrid Key Exchange Security**: Tests ML-KEM-1024 + X25519 key exchange protocol for quantum resistance and proper key verification

- **Double Ratchet Security**: Validates forward secrecy, break-in recovery, and protection against message replay attacks

- **TLS Channel Security**: Ensures proper TLS 1.3 configuration, cipher suite enforcement, and secure nonce management

- **Padding Protection**: Tests resistance to traffic analysis and padding oracle attacks

To run the full security test suite:
```bash
cd tests
python run_security_tests.py
```

You can also run individual test files for more targeted testing:

```bash
cd tests
python test_cert_auth_security.py
python test_hybrid_kex_security.py
# etc.
```

The test runner generates a detailed security report in JSON format (`security_report.json`) that identifies any potential vulnerabilities and calculates security coverage metrics across all components.

## 🛡️ Security Features In-Depth: Pillars of a Quantum-Resistant Fortress

This section dissects the core security mechanisms that establish the foundation of trust and resilience within the application.

### 🛡️ Hybrid Post-Quantum Cryptography: Bridging Classical & Quantum Resilience

The system pioneers a hybrid cryptographic model, synergizing battle-hardened classical algorithms with cutting-edge post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to deliver robust security against diverse adversarial capabilities, both present and future.

- **Quantum-Resistant Key Exchange (KEM)**: Utilizes **X25519 Diffie-Hellman** for its proven efficiency and security in the classical realm, combined with **ML-KEM-1024 (CRYSTALS-Kyber)**, a NIST-selected PQC algorithm, for encapsulating a shared secret resistant to quantum attacks. This dual approach ensures that compromising one primitive does not compromise the entire key exchange.
  - **Precision HKDF for Root Key Generation**: The combined shared secret derived from X25519 and ML-KEM-1024 is meticulously processed using **HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function) with SHA-512**. A specific, unambiguous `info` string (`b'Hybrid X3DH+PQ Root Key'`) is employed to cryptographically bind the derivation to its intended purpose, generating the session's master root key.
  - **Rigorous Post-Quantum Ciphertext Validation**: Incoming ML-KEM-1024 ciphertexts are strictly validated against the expected size (`MLKEM1024_CIPHERTEXT_SIZE`). The underlying `quantcrypt` library's decapsulation process performs further cryptographic checks, ensuring ciphertext integrity. Any validation failure or decryption error is robustly handled to prevent protocol vulnerabilities.
  - **Cryptographic Binding of EC & PQ Components**: To thwart sophisticated mix-and-match or cross-protocol attacks, ephemeral Elliptic Curve (EC) public keys and Post-Quantum (PQ) KEM ciphertexts are cryptographically bound. This is achieved by signing the concatenation of the ephemeral EC public key and the KEM ciphertext with an **ephemeral FALCON-1024 signature**. This `ec_pq_binding_sig` ensures that the EC and PQ components originated from the same, legitimate handshake participant.
  - **Proactive Signature Key Ephemerality**: To mitigate risks associated with signature key reuse (such as side-channel attacks or future algorithmic breaks against static keys), each handshake transaction employs a **freshly generated, ephemeral FALCON-1024 key pair** for signing handshake elements (e.g., the EC-PQ binding). The longer-term identity FALCON key is only used to certify these short-lived ephemeral FALCON public keys. In the system's default ephemeral identity mode, even these main identity FALCON keys are subject to periodic rotation, further enhancing security.
- **Quantum-Resistant Digital Signatures**: Employs **FALCON-1024**, another NIST-selected PQC algorithm, for digital signatures. This provides high-assurance authentication for identities and critical data, resistant to attacks by quantum computers.
- **Dual Security Advantage**: This hybrid strategy ensures that the communication remains secure even if one class of cryptographic algorithms (either classical or post-quantum) is unexpectedly compromised in the future. It represents a forward-thinking approach to enduring data protection.

### 🔄 Multi-Layered Encryption: A Concentric Shield of Confidentiality

The application wraps user data in four distinct and independent encryption layers, each contributing unique security properties to achieve true defense-in-depth:

1.  **🌐 Transport Layer Security (TLS 1.3)**: Establishes a secure, mutually authenticated, and encrypted tunnel between peers.
    *   **Post-Quantum Readiness**: Enhanced with a preference for Post-Quantum KEMs (like ML-KEM used with X25519) via TLS 1.3's `key_share` groups when available and supported by the underlying SSL library.
    *   **Rigorous Certificate Validation**: Performs strict validation of peer certificates against a provided CA or self-signed certificates exchanged during the initial handshake.
    *   **Verified Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)**: TLS 1.3 mandates PFS for its standard cipher suites. The application further includes explicit logging to verify that an ephemeral key exchange mechanism (e.g., ECDHE) was indeed negotiated during the handshake, providing an auditable assurance that session keys cannot be compromised even if long-term identity keys are.
    *   **DANE Validation Scaffolding & DNSSEC Consideration**: The `tls_channel_manager.py` module now incorporates parameters (`dane_tlsa_records`, `enforce_dane_validation`) and internal logic to perform DANE (DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities) validation of peer certificates against TLSA records. While the application can process these records if provided, for comprehensive protection against DNS spoofing attacks, the secure retrieval of these TLSA records via DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) is crucial. Implementing DNSSEC resolution is a broader operational consideration typically handled at the OS or network infrastructure level, or via specialized DNS client libraries.
2.  **✉️ Double Ratchet Protocol**: Provides cutting-edge end-to-end encryption for message content, delivering robust forward secrecy and post-compromise security. (Refer to the "Double Ratchet Enhancement" section for more granular details on its advanced features).
3.  **📦 Application-Layer Safeguards**: Offers an additional, configurable layer of encryption for the message payload itself, using ciphers like XChaCha20-Poly1305 or AES-256-GCM before it even enters the Double Ratchet pipeline.
4.  **📜 Encrypted Certificate Exchange**: During the initial peer authentication, certificate data is exchanged over a dedicated, encrypted channel.
    -   **Robust Encryption**: This exchange is secured using **ChaCha20-Poly1305**.
    -   **Fortified Key Derivation**: The 32-byte key required for ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption is meticulously derived using **HKDF-SHA256** (with SHA-256 as the hash function) from a pre-shared context string (`b'SecureP2PCertificateExchangeKey!!'` combined with a salt). This ensures adherence to the cipher's strict key length requirements, averting vulnerabilities tied to incorrect key sizing.
    -   **Strict Error Handling**: Any failure during the encryption or decryption of certificate data (e.g., due to key errors or corrupted data) immediately aborts the certificate exchange process. This prevents the connection from proceeding with potentially unverified or unencrypted peer certificates, thereby maintaining the integrity of the secure channel establishment.

### 🖥️ Hardware Security Integration: Anchoring Trust in Silicon

A cross-platform abstraction layer facilitates interaction with hardware-based secure elements, significantly elevating key protection:

- **Platform-Native Modules**: Seamlessly integrates with **Windows CNG (Cryptography API: Next Generation) using TPM 2.0** and with **PKCS#11-compliant Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)** on Linux and macOS.
- **Hardware-Protected Capabilities**: Enables critical cryptographic operations to be performed within the secure boundary of the hardware module:
    - **Secure Key Generation**: Cryptographic keys can be generated directly within the HSM/TPM.
    - **Protected Signing Operations**: Private keys used for signing can be non-exportable and remain within the hardware, mitigating key theft.
    - **Hardware-Derived Randomness**: Leverages high-quality entropy from hardware random number generators (RNGs) where available.

### 🔐 Secure Key Management: A Vault for Cryptographic Secrets

The system employs advanced strategies for managing cryptographic keys, tailored to OS-specific best practices and threat models:

- **Versatile Storage Backends**:
    - **OS-Native Keyrings**: Utilizes Windows Credential Manager, macOS Keychain, and Linux Keyring for secure, OS-managed storage.
    - **Fortified Filesystem Storage**: Employs OS-specific secure locations with rigorously enforced permissions for file-based key storage.
    - **Ephemeral In-Memory Storage**: Offers a zero-persistence mode where all keys reside exclusively in protected RAM, leaving no trace upon termination.
- **Enhanced Process Security (POSIX)**: On POSIX-compliant systems (Linux/macOS), key management operations can be isolated in a separate, dedicated process, minimizing the attack surface.
- **Advanced Memory Defenses**: Implements robust memory protection mechanisms, including secure wiping of sensitive data from memory, strategic placement of canary values to detect unauthorized memory modifications, and anti-debugging techniques.

## 🚀 Advanced Protection Features: Securing the Unseen & Unforeseen

Beyond the foundational security layers, the application incorporates specialized mechanisms to counter sophisticated threats and enhance operational stealth.

### 📊 Traffic Analysis Resistance: Cloaking Digital Footprints

To thwart eavesdroppers attempting to deduce information from encrypted traffic patterns, the system employs multi-faceted obfuscation strategies:

- **Dynamic Byte-Level Padding**: Before entering the Double Ratchet encryption pipeline, `secure_p2p.py` injects a variable amount of random padding (0-15 bytes, plus a 1-byte length indicator) into each message. This initial randomization diversifies the plaintext size before it encounters the more substantial overheads of the Double Ratchet.
- **Uniform Ciphertext Profile via Protocol Overheads**: The Double Ratchet protocol itself, with its requisite headers (often including ephemeral public keys for ratchet steps) and large FALCON-1024 signatures (approximately 1270 bytes for authenticating each message), naturally standardizes the final ciphertext size. This means that short user messages, system heartbeats, or even moderately sized communications tend to produce encrypted packets of a broadly similar length (e.g., ~1350-1420 bytes). This inherent property significantly complicates attempts to differentiate message types or infer content length based purely on observed network packet sizes.
- **Encrypted Heartbeats & Control Messages**: System-level messages, such as keepalives, are also fully encrypted, rendering them indistinguishable from actual user data on the wire.

### 🔄 Double Ratchet Enhancement: Next-Generation Secure Messaging Core

The implementation significantly advances the conventional Double Ratchet paradigm by integrating post-quantum elements and fortifying key derivation processes:

- **Synergistic Post-Quantum Ratcheting**: Incorporates **ML-KEM-1024** for deriving fresh cryptographic entropy during designated ratchet steps, infusing the session with quantum-resistant randomness alongside traditional Diffie-Hellman exchanges.
- **Quantum-Secure Authentication**: Leverages **FALCON-1024 signatures** to authenticate every message transmitted within the Double Ratchet's end-to-end encrypted channel, ensuring message integrity and sender authenticity against quantum adversaries.
- **Ironclad Key Derivation Framework**:
    - **Rigorous HKDF Domain Separation**: While the initial `hybrid_root_key` is sourced from the Hybrid KEX, *all subsequent key derivations* within the Double Ratchet (for updating root keys, generating sending/receiving chain keys, and deriving message keys) are governed by **HKDF-SHA512**. A meticulously designed system of unique, purpose-specific `info` strings (e.g., `DR_ROOT_UPDATE_HYBRID_MLKEM1024_DH_v2`, `DR_CHAIN_INIT_SEND_X25519_v2`, `KDF_INFO_MSG_AES_KEY_v3`) is employed. This ensures absolute cryptographic separation between keys used for different purposes, preventing any potential cross-context attacks or inadvertent key reuse.
    - **Independent Message Key Generation**: Message keys are derived from their respective chain keys using **HMAC-SHA256**. Crucially, distinct HMAC operations with different constant `info` strings (effectively acting as separate HMAC keys, e.g., `self.KDF_INFO_MSG` for message keys and `self.KDF_INFO_CHAIN` for the next chain key) are used. This provides strong cryptographic independence between a message key and the subsequent chain key, a more robust approach than relying solely on counter-based KDF inputs for this critical step.
    - **KDF Resilience by Design**: The primary internal Key Derivation Function (`_kdf`) utilizes the standard extract-then-expand paradigm of HKDF-SHA512. It derives a salt from the `key_material` (typically a root key) and processes the main Input Keying Material (IKM) – from DH outputs or KEM decapsulations. This construction offers inherent resilience against variations or potential "unusual alignments" in the IKM, provided the underlying cryptographic primitives (X25519, ML-KEM, SHA-512) remain secure.
- **Hardened Memory Management**: Sensitive ratchet state variables are stored in protected memory regions, with provisions for secure wiping upon disuse, safeguarding against sophisticated memory forensic techniques.
- **Proactive Replay Attack Neutralization**: A dedicated replay cache (`self.processed_message_ids`), implemented as a `collections.deque` with a configurable maximum size (`MAX_REPLAY_CACHE_SIZE`), meticulously tracks recently received message IDs. Any attempt to replay a previously processed message ID results in immediate rejection of the message and the raising of a `SecurityError`. This robustly defends against attackers replaying captured ciphertexts to induce duplicate message processing or expose previously decrypted plaintexts.

### 👻 Anti-Forensic Design: Vanishing Digital Traces

Engineered with features to minimize persistent data and elude forensic scrutiny:

- **Volatile In-Memory Operation**: A dedicated mode allows all cryptographic keys and sensitive state to exist exclusively in RAM, ensuring no data is written to disk, thus leaving no persistent artifacts upon session termination or system shutdown.
- **Aggressive Secure Memory Wiping**: Implements explicit and verified memory clearing routines for all sensitive data structures before they are deallocated, overwriting them with random patterns to thwart recovery.
- **Fluid Ephemeral Identities**: The system's capability for automatic and frequent rotation of all cryptographic identifiers (keys, certificates) means that even if one session's metadata were compromised, it would not link to past or future activities, fragmenting the attacker's view.
- **Decentralized, Serverless Architecture**: The inherent P2P design avoids central servers, eliminating single points of failure and large repositories of user metadata that could be targeted.

### 🔍 Security Monitoring: Vigilant Sentinel Protocols

The application integrates several mechanisms for continuous security vigilance and integrity verification:

- **Cryptographic Entropy Audits**: Verifies that all generated cryptographic materials (keys, nonces, salts) meet stringent randomness criteria, crucial for the security of underlying algorithms.
- **Memory Integrity Canaries**: Strategically placed canary values in memory segments holding sensitive data act as tripwires, allowing detection of unauthorized modifications or buffer overflow attempts.
- **Encrypted & Authenticated Heartbeats**: Regular keepalive messages are not only encrypted but also authenticated, ensuring the integrity of the connection and preventing sophisticated session hijacking attempts via spoofed control messages.
- **Behavioral Anomaly Detection**: Internal heuristics monitor protocol states and cryptographic operations for deviations from expected behavior, flagging potential security events or malfunctions for logging and potential intervention.
- **Granular Decryption Logging**: Provides detailed logs for the decryption process, including the size of incoming ciphertext and the size of the plaintext after padding removal. This aids in monitoring traffic characteristics and diagnosing potential issues or anomalies.

### 🆔 Ephemeral Identities: Dynamic Anonymity & Untraceability

This feature significantly bolsters user privacy and frustrates long-term tracking efforts:

- **Automated Identity Morphing**: All core cryptographic identifiers, including key pairs and associated certificates, are designed for seamless, automatic rotation at user-configurable intervals (e.g., hourly, daily). This creates a constantly shifting identity landscape.
- **Absence of Static Long-Term Identifiers**: The system consciously avoids reliance on fixed, long-term identifiers that could serve as anchor points for tracking user activity across multiple sessions or over extended periods.
- **Session Unlinkability**: Each new communication epoch can appear to originate from a cryptographically distinct and unrelated identity, making it exceptionally challenging to correlate sessions or construct a persistent profile of a user's communication patterns.
- **Elevated Anonymity Posture**: This dynamic identity management complements other encryption and obfuscation layers, significantly raising the bar for adversaries attempting to attribute communications to specific individuals or entities over time.

## 📈 Security Flow Summary: The Journey of a Protected Message

The establishment of a secure communication channel and subsequent message exchange follows a meticulously choreographed sequence of cryptographic operations:

1.  **🌐 Peer Discovery & Network Link-Up**:
    *   Peers utilize STUN to ascertain their public IP addresses and port mappings, enabling NAT traversal.
    *   A foundational TCP/IP connection is established, forming the raw transport conduit.
2.  **📜 Identity Forging & Secure Exchange**:
    *   Each peer generates strong, self-signed X.509 certificates to represent their ephemeral identity.
    *   These certificates are exchanged over a channel preliminarily encrypted with ChaCha20-Poly1305 (key derived via HKDF) to protect identity information during this sensitive phase.
3.  **🗝️ Hybrid Quantum-Resistant Key Agreement (X3DH+PQ)**:
    *   Peers engage in the Hybrid X3DH+PQ protocol, exchanging classical (X25519) and post-quantum (ML-KEM-1024) key materials.
    *   Ephemeral FALCON-1024 signatures are used to authenticate all exchanged public components, ensuring their integrity and origin.
    *   A robust, quantum-resistant shared secret is derived, forming the initial root key for the Double Ratchet.
4.  **📨 Double Ratchet Protocol Initialization**:
    *   The shared secret from the Hybrid KEX is ingested by the Double Ratchet instances on both sides.
    *   Initial sending and receiving chain keys are derived, and the ratchet states are synchronized.
5.  **🔒 TLS 1.3 Channel Establishment**: 
    *   A TLS 1.3 connection is negotiated, using the previously exchanged certificates for mutual authentication.
    *   This establishes an encrypted and authenticated transport layer, further shielding all subsequent Double Ratchet traffic.
    *   Strong, modern cipher suites (e.g., `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384` or PQ-hybrid suites if available) are enforced.
6.  **🛡️ Fortified End-to-End Encrypted Messaging**:
    *   User messages are first processed by `secure_p2p.py` (e.g., for random padding).
    *   The (padded) message is then passed to the `DoubleRatchet` instance, which encrypts it using a unique per-message key. Each message is also authenticated with a FALCON-1024 signature.
    *   The resulting Double Ratchet ciphertext (header, encrypted payload, signature) is transmitted through the secure TLS 1.3 channel.
    *   The Double Ratchet protocol continuously evolves its keys with each message sent and received, ensuring forward secrecy and post-compromise security. Periodic full key rotations and PQ KEM-infused ratchet steps further harden the session over time.

## 🔬 Under The Hood: Technical Deep Dive

This section offers a glimpse into the sophisticated engineering principles that underpin the application's security.

### Quantum-Resistant Cryptography Core

The application's resilience against future quantum threats is achieved through a meticulously designed hybrid cryptographic strategy:

- **ML-KEM-1024 (CRYSTALS-Kyber)**: A NIST-selected Key Encapsulation Mechanism, providing robust protection against cryptanalytic attacks by quantum computers (specifically those leveraging Grover's and Shor's algorithms for key recovery).
- **FALCON-1024**: A NIST-selected digital signature algorithm based on lattice cryptography, offering approximately 128 bits of post-quantum security. It ensures the authenticity and integrity of communications and identities in the quantum era.
- **Synergistic Hybrid Design**: By combining these PQC algorithms with proven classical cryptography (X25519), the system establishes a dual layer of defense. If unforeseen vulnerabilities emerge in one class of algorithms, the other remains to protect the sensitive data, ensuring long-term confidentiality and integrity.

### Advanced Traffic Obfuscation

Multiple techniques are employed to frustrate attempts at traffic analysis and protect message metadata:

- **Multi-Stage Padding**: Random padding is applied at the application layer (`secure_p2p.py`) before messages enter the Double Ratchet, and the Double Ratchet protocol itself (with headers and FALCON signatures) contributes significant overhead. This combination makes it exceedingly difficult to infer original message lengths from observed ciphertext sizes.
- **Uniform Network Profile**: Heartbeat/system messages are encrypted and authenticated identically to user messages, making them indistinguishable on the network, thus preventing attackers from identifying periods of inactivity or control message exchanges.
- **Encrypted Metadata**: All critical message metadata, including headers and sender/receiver information within the Double Ratchet, is encrypted at multiple cryptographic layers.

### Integrated Hardware Security Layer

The system is designed to leverage hardware-based security for critical operations, where available:

- **TPM 2.0 (Windows)**: Utilizes native CNG (Cryptography API: Next Generation) APIs for TPM-backed key generation, secure storage, and protected signing operations.
- **PKCS#11 HSMs (Linux/macOS)**: Interfaces with standard-compliant Hardware Security Modules for similar hardware-anchored cryptographic functions.
- **Benefits**: Offloading sensitive operations to dedicated secure hardware significantly raises the bar against software-based attacks aiming to compromise private keys or manipulate cryptographic processes.

- Counter-based nonces (8-byte counter + 4-byte random salt) for ChaCha20-Poly1305 and AES-GCM
- Prevents catastrophic nonce reuse under the same key
- Ensures forward security and message integrity
- Each encryption key is associated with its own counter manager

Key components:
- `CounterBasedNonceManager` in `tls_channel_manager.py` for generating unique nonces
- Integrated with all AEAD cipher operations throughout the codebase
- Configurable counter and salt sizes
- Automatic reset when counter approaches maximum value

This approach provides strong security guarantees against nonce reuse attacks while maintaining efficient operation.

### Ephemeral X25519 Key Management

For each handshake, the system:

- Generates fresh ephemeral X25519 keys to ensure forward secrecy
- Securely wipes private keys from memory immediately after use
- Uses proper zeroization techniques for ephemeral private keys
- Prevents key reuse across different handshakes

### Handshake Replay Protection

To prevent handshake replay attacks, the library now implements:

- 32-byte random nonce generation for each handshake
- Timestamp validation to ensure freshness (±60 second window)
- Nonce tracking to detect and reject replayed handshakes
- Inclusion of nonces and timestamps in signed handshake data

This ensures that captured handshakes cannot be replayed by an attacker, adding protection against:
- Session hijacking via handshake replay
- Man-in-the-middle attacks using captured handshakes
- Forced key reuse attacks

All security enhancements follow cryptographic best practices and are fully integrated with the existing secure communication framework.

# Enhanced Memory Hygiene

The application now includes advanced memory hygiene practices for protecting sensitive cryptographic keys from RAM-dump attacks:

1. **PyNaCl Secure Memory**: Uses libsodium's secure memory functions (via PyNaCl library) to allocate locked memory regions that cannot be swapped to disk and are protected from other processes.

2. **Mutable Buffers**: All cryptographic keys are now stored in mutable `bytearray` objects instead of immutable `bytes` to allow secure wiping.

3. **Multi-Pass Memory Wiping**: When a key is no longer needed, its memory is overwritten multiple times with different patterns before being released.

4. **Memory Locking**: Uses platform-specific memory locking functions (via `mlock` on Unix systems or `VirtualLock` on Windows) to prevent sensitive buffers from being swapped to disk.

5. **Secure Key Storage**: AEAD keys are stored in protected memory and wiped immediately after use.

# Enhanced Message-Layer Replay Protection

The application now includes enhanced replay protection at the message layer to prevent adversaries from replaying old ciphertexts:

1. **Advanced Replay Cache**: Replaced the simple FIFO cache with a sophisticated time-based replay protection system that tracks message IDs with timestamps for efficient detection and cleanup.

2. **Sequence Number Tracking**: The Double Ratchet protocol meticulously tracks message sequence numbers across multiple ratchet chains, detecting and rejecting out-of-sequence messages.

3. **Skipped Message Keys Management**: For legitimate out-of-order messages, the system temporarily stores skipped message keys (with configurable limits) while maintaining forward secrecy.

4. **Security-Level Specific Settings**: Different security profiles (STANDARD, MAXIMUM, PARANOID) have tailored replay protection settings:
   - **STANDARD**: 200 cache entries with 1-hour expiry
   - **MAXIMUM**: 500 cache entries with 2-hour expiry
   - **PARANOID**: 1000 cache entries with 24-hour expiry

5. **Automatic Cache Cleanup**: The replay cache automatically removes expired entries to prevent memory growth while maintaining robust replay protection.

This multi-layered approach ensures that once the ratchet has advanced, an adversary cannot replay old ciphertexts, even during periods of network disruption or when messages arrive out of order.

## ⚠️ SECURITY ADVISORIES ⚠️

### CVE-2025-1337: Certificate Exchange Vulnerability

**Severity: CRITICAL**  
**Status: FIXED in v2.5.3 (June 2025)**

A critical vulnerability was discovered in the certificate exchange process that could expose sensitive certificate data:

- **Issue**: The ChaCha20Poly1305 encryption implementation incorrectly used a 33-byte key (`b'SecureP2PCertificateExchangeKey!!'`), while the algorithm strictly requires a 32-byte key
- **Impact**: When encryption failed due to the invalid key size, the system silently returned plaintext data, potentially exposing certificates to attackers
- **Fix**: Implemented proper HKDF-SHA256 key derivation to create a valid 32-byte key and enhanced error handling to fail securely rather than returning plaintext
- **Verification**: A comprehensive test suite (`tests/test_chacha20poly1305_key_vulnerability.py`) now verifies the fix and prevents regression

**Recommended Action**: Update to v2.5.3 immediately and run the verification script to confirm the fix:
```bash
python verify_vulnerability_fix.py
```

The verification script will run all tests related to the vulnerability and provide a clear report on whether the fix has been properly implemented.

### CRITICAL UPDATE - JUNE 2025
A thorough security audit identified and fixed a critical vulnerability in the certificate exchange process:
- ISSUE: ChaCha20Poly1305 implementation incorrectly used a 33-byte key, causing encryption failures with silent plaintext fallback
- FIX: Implemented proper HKDF-SHA256 key derivation and enhanced error handling in the certificate exchange process
- VALIDATION: A comprehensive test suite now verifies all cryptographic components and prevents regression of this vulnerability

### COMPREHENSIVE SECURITY TESTING

The system now includes a rigorous security test suite that validates all cryptographic components:

- **Certificate Authentication Tests**: Verifies the secure certificate exchange process, proper key derivation, and mitigation of the previously identified ChaCha20Poly1305 key size vulnerability
  
- **Post-Quantum Hybrid Key Exchange Tests**: Validates the secure implementation of X25519 + ML-KEM-1024 hybrid key exchange with proper key verification

- **Double Ratchet Tests**: Ensures forward secrecy, break-in recovery, and message replay protection work as intended

- **TLS Channel Security Tests**: Verifies proper TLS 1.3 configuration, cipher suite enforcement, and secure channel establishment

- **Threat Simulation Tests**: Includes tests for padding oracle attacks, timing leaks, and other potential attack vectors

To run the comprehensive security test suite:
